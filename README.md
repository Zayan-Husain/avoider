This is an avoider game, made with p5 and p5 play and a framework I created.
As you play the game and get more points, the game gets harder.
Controls: W = Forward, S = Backward, A = Left, D = Right.
You can take risks and get coins that greatly boost your score.
Sometimes bombs fall on the map. Do not go near them (If you want to survive).
